# Meta-Adaptation
Codes and data of meta-learning based runtime adaptation for WSANs

we develop MERA, a meta-learning based runtime adaptation method, which efficiently adapts network configuration models for industrial WSANs at runtime. Under MERA, the parameters of the network configuration model are explicitly trained such that a small number of optimization steps with only a few new measurements will produce good generalization performance after the network condition changes.

# MERA

We implement MERA using Python under PyTorch and evaluate its performance on a physical testbed that consists of 50 nodes.
