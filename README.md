Codes and data of meta-learning based runtime adaptation for WSANs

We develop a meta-learning based runtime adaptation method, which efficiently adapts network configuration models for industrial WSANs at runtime. The parameters of the network configuration model are explicitly trained such that a small number of optimization steps with only a few new measurements will produce good generalization performance after the network condition changes.
